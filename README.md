# Notizen
A note taking app with extensible tagging components.

The idea behind Notizen is to be able to take notes and tag them with different tags like:
- Time: This displays an editable hour that defaults to the current hour, common uses could include tracking development by time, or plan a day (like an agenda).

- Color: This could tag each note by a different color so as to organize them.

- Text: A text tag that automatically colors the text with a unique color depending on the text.

- Checkbox: For items that you  ay want to mark as completed.

... and you can create your own very easily!
